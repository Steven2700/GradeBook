# GradeBook
I coded this to create and simulate a gradebook by taking in different student grade scores and keeping counts of each letter grade that is inputted. After all the student grade scores are inputted, the user then takes the action of dividing the total score by the score count to ultimately output the avaerage class grade score along with the total number of A's B's C's D's and F's that were inputted.
